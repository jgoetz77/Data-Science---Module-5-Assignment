Question 4: Calculating Overall Statistics 
Context: 
You are interested in learning about the proportion of patients that fall into each level of status. Later you will sample the population and compare the values generated by that sample to the values found here using the full data set. 
Instructions: 
- Use levels() to examine the unique values found in the status column of mydata. Recall that levels() requires a factor vector as its only argument.
- Use dplyr to generate a summary table that contains the proportion of records in mydata 
containing each value of status. This table should have two columns: status and proportion, and be stored in an object called overall_values.
Hint: The proportion will be equal to the number of occurances of each level of status divided by the total number of rows in mydata. Consider how you might use group_by(), summarise(), n(), and nrow() to accomplish this task.

Question 5: Simple Random Sampling 
Context: 
Sampling a population is a common analytical task. The easiest way to do this is using simple random sampling. Values calculated using the full dataset should be comparable to those calculated using a random sample of the dataset. Here, you will calculate the proportion of the data that falls into each level of status. 
Instructions: 
- Use set.seed(123) to ensure reproducibility.
- Subset a simple random sample of 30 patients using sample_n(). Store this subset in an object called mysimple.
- Generate a summary table that contains the proportion of records in mysimple with each level of status. It should have two columns: status and proportion. Store this data frame in an object called simple_values.

Question 6: Stratified Random Sampling 
Context: 
Stratified random sampling occurs when a variable in the data is used to direct how the population is sampled. This variable typically relates to some structural characteristic of the population that you want to be reflected in the subset used for analysis. For example, 62 % of the patients in the mydata data set are male. Therefore, a simple random sample of the data would likely contain more male patients than female. If you wanted to ensure that the subset contains an equal number of males and females, you would use stratified random sampling. 
Instructions: 
- Use set.seed(123) to ensure reproducibility.
- Subset a random sample of 30 patients using sample_n(). Ensure that this subset includes an equal number of males and females by including group_by() in the dplyr pipeline. Store this subset in an object called mystratified.
- Generate a summary table that contains the proportion of patients in each level of status using the subset mystratified. It should have two columns: status and proportion. Store this data frame in an object called stratified_values. 
Please note that small sample sizes like the ones demonstrated here are not reliable for inference! Here, we are only illustrating the process of how to generate a random stratified sample.

Question 7: Calculating Confidence Limits 
Context: 
Typically, the confidence interval will provide you with the upper and lower ranges where our sample statistic (like a mean, or variance for example) will fall within 95 % of the time. While 95 % is the most commonly used value, it may be appropriate to be more conservative (i.e. 99 %) or less conservative (i.e. 80 %) depending on the question being asked. Here, you know that the age variable is approximately normally distributed, and will need to compute the 95 % confidence interval around the mean age. 
Instructions: - Find the mean value of age in mydata; store this in an object called mu.
- Find the standard deviation of age in mydata; store this in an object called sigma.
- Find the number of samples of age in mydata; store this in an object called n.
- Calculate the error using sigma, and n, and the function qnorm(); store this in an object called error. 
- Find the lower confidence limit by subtracting error from mu; store this in an object called lower.
- Find the upper confidence limit by adding error to mu; store this in an object called upper.

Week 5 Quiz:
1.	If we use a random seed of 1234, what is the number of heads we get when we flip a fair coin 20 times assuming we call a “head” = 1 in sample?

sample(c(1,0), size=20, replace=TRUE)
#---OR---
set.seed(1234)
rbinom(20, 1,.5)
 [1] 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0


With this random seed we have 11 heads, although as n gets large we would expect a
50% to be heads and 50% to be tails.

2.	Let’s say we are simulating some data for a bank. We know that we expect 2% of loans to be “bad” and 98% of loans to be good. Let’s say we have a dataset of 200,000 loans called creditData with an outcome variable called goodBadFlag. If we want a stratified random sample of 2,000 loans, what R code would we need to write?(assume we use a random seed of 1234)
library(dplyr) set.seed(1234) loan_sample = creditData %>% 
group_by(goodBadFlag) %>% 
sample_n(2000)

That's correct! We are sampling in proportion to our good/ bad outcome, so we expect approximately 2,000 x 2% = 40 bad loans and 1,960 good loans in our sample.
Hence, library(dplyr) set.seed(1234) loan_sample = creditData %>% group_by(goodBadFlag) %>% sample_n(2000) is the correct answer. 

3.	What R code would you write to flip a biased coin 100 times, which has a 0.6 probability of a head and a 0.4 probability of a tail?
(assume we use a random seed of 1234)
(hint: look at the sample function in R)
set.seed(1234) sample(c(1,0), size=100, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.6,0.4))

We are sampling with replacement, we have prob=c(0.6,0.4) as the argument in our sample function to reflect the bias in the coin. Hence, set.seed(1234) sample(c(1,0), size=100, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.6,0.4)) is the correct answer.

4.	Open an RStudio session and run the following code:
set.seed(1234)  
x <- rnorm(10000)
plot(ecdf(x), main="CDF plot of 10,000 samples \n from normal distribution N(0,1)")
P = ecdf(x)
P(0.5)

The screen will show 0.6931. This gives the Pr(x < 0). That is the probability that a random x from the normal distribution we simulated with mean=0 and sd=1 will be less than 0. What is the probability that a random x from this distribution is less than 2?
Hint: In other words calculate Pr(x < 2) from this distribution.
> set.seed(1234)  
> x <- rnorm(10000)
> plot(ecdf(x), main="CDF plot of 10,000 samples \n from normal distribution N(0,1)")
> P = ecdf(x)
> P(0.5)
[1] 0.6931

 

?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????



5.	Which of the following is true of the normal distribution?
 

Which of the following is true?
The mean will be 0 and the standard deviation is 1. We expect 99.6% of observations to be within 3 standard deviations.
